# rl-playground
 Trying different RL + DeepRL approaches on known benchmarks

 ### Dynamic Programming
 Implements policy iteration and value iteration. Environment: OpenAI Gym - Frozenlake. 

 ### Monte Carlo
 Implements Monte Carlo Prediction and Monte Carlo Control (on-policy). Environment: OpenAI Gym - Blackjack. 

 ### Model-based control vs Model-free RL
 System identification + LQR vs Policy gradient, Random search, Uniform sampling. The notebook is based on Ben Recht's [excellent blog posts](http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/26/nominal/) about the relationships of optimal control and RL.
